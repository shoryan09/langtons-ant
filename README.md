# 🐜 Langton's Ant Simulation

A browser-based simulation of **Langton's Ant**, a two-dimensional Turing machine that reveals how simple rules can create surprisingly complex and emergent behavior — right from your browser.

## 📌 What is Langton’s Ant?

Langton’s Ant is a cellular automaton devised by Chris Langton in 1986. It features an "ant" that moves on a grid of black and white squares following just two rules:

1. **Turn right** on a white cell, flip it to black.
2. **Turn left** on a black cell, flip it to white.

Despite these minimal rules, the system goes through three distinct phases:
- A short **symmetric phase**
- A long **chaotic phase**
- A final **"highway phase"**, where the ant builds an endlessly repeating pattern

Langton's Ant is also **Turing complete**, capable of simulating any computation given enough space.
